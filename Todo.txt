What happens when creating clan that already exists
creating war with more participents then one with less, error because extras aren't over ridden from user data

Inject clan name into services
Databinding for recyclerview items
standardize click animation on recycler views
UI
listen for admin changes on home activity - presenter display admin ui
Can't join with same name as already exists
use fragment manager correctly
Screens with loading, have ui visible loading bar hidden
Timestamp validates correctly serverside

Issues screen: Upvotes, comments - tab view: suggestions, bugs, general chat

Notification fragment
push Notifications
Image uploading

1:
Timber
Analytics/Crash Reporting
Two clan names in database: lowercase for searching and one with proper capitalization
get stuck if removed from clan (can’t happen yet) and user’s state doesn’t update, check for read denied
Switch claims to objects
War vs Enemy Clan on top of recycler view
Make fbservices parse datasnapshots in seperate methods
Make FbServices use “this” as valueeventlistener so we can cancel loads
icon on navdrawer gets out of frame/big

2:
using current time in milies in comments for war bases instead of server value
don’t allow to pick usernames not taken in clan
don’t allow to create same clan/join clan when access to description
When going to intent activity if value isn’t there throw
put variable for all fields in api clan
make wrapper for value event listener that times out, null check, cast?
? make changing ids to names available to all FbServices (inside of FbInfo) ?
make a class that loads initial and ignores the reloads
combine shared methods class’s
customized login
interfaces to button in Service Contracts
sideways orientation
